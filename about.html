	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<div class="education">
		<p>Graduating from the University of Oregon with a Bachelor's of Science and a Minor in Computer Information Technology
		provided me with experience working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, PHP, and Git.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="experience">
		<p>I worked for the Wesley Community Center in Eugene, Oregon where I designed their first website in Wordpress and updated it with news and pictures from community events.
		This included designing the layout with CSS and setting up calendar and email newsletter widgets.</p>
		<p>My time working as a student grader for my university's CIS 111 class allowed me to hone my fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
